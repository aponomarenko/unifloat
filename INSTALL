# How to build from source

## Requirements

### Common requirements
In order to build libunifloat, you need to install several components:

- A C compiler
- CMake >= 2.6.0

## Building
First, you need to configure the compilation, using CMake. Go to the
`build` dir. Create it if it doesn't exist.

GNU/Linux and MacOS X:

    cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
    make

### CMake standard options
Here is a list of the most interesting options provided out of the box by
CMake.

- CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:     The type of build (can be Debug or Release)
- CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX: The prefix to use when running make install (Default
                        to /usr/local on GNU/Linux and MacOS X)
- CMAKE_C_COMPILER:     The path to the C compiler
- CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER:   The path to the C++ compiler

## Installing
If you want to install the library after compilation run:

    make install

## Testing
Run in the build directory to compile tests executable:

    make tests

Execute tests:

    ./tests/tests
